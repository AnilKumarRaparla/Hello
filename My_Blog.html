            <h3>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript are the core technologies used for building interactive and user-friendly web
              applications. HTML5 provides the structure of the webpage, CSS3 is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript
              adds interactivity and behavior to the website.
