      <p>
        Hello! My name is Anil Kumar Raparla, and I am an enthusiastic and ambitious fresher aspiring to become a skilled Web Developer and Cloud Database Administrator.

        As a recent graduate in Computer Science, I am passionate about building modern and engaging websites. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm eager to learn and explore new technologies and frameworks to enhance my development skills. I enjoy creating user-friendly and responsive interfaces that deliver a seamless experience to users.

        In addition to web development, I am also fascinated by the world of cloud computing and database management. I am familiar with the basics of cloud technologies like AWS and Azure and have a keen interest in understanding how cloud databases work. I am eager to dive deeper into cloud computing concepts and gain hands-on experience in managing databases on cloud platforms.

        During my academic journey, I undertook various projects that allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving abilities, teamwork skills, and attention to detail.

        While I may be a fresher, I am highly motivated to learn and grow in the web development and cloud database administration domains. I am open to internships and entry-level opportunities that will enable me to contribute to exciting projects and gain valuable industry experience.

        When I'm not coding or exploring the latest tech trends, I enjoy spending time honing my creativity through photography and engaging in outdoor activities.

        I am actively seeking opportunities to work with passionate teams and contribute my skills to make a positive impact in the digital world. If you believe I could be a good fit for your team or have any advice to offer, I'd love to connect with you. Let's collaborate and create innovative solutions together!

            <h3>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript are the core technologies used for building interactive and user-friendly web
              applications. HTML5 provides the structure of the webpage, CSS3 is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript
              adds interactivity and behavior to the website.
